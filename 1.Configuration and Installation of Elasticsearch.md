## ELK Essentials: Exploring Elasticsearch Architechture and Components Crash Course

What is a SIEM?  
SIEM, or Security Information and Event Management, is a cybersecurity solution that collects, analyzes, and correlates log and event data from various sources across an IT environment to enhance threat detection, incident investigation, and compliance reporting.
ELK is a SIEM also known as Elastic Stack.

## Setting up ELK on DOCKER
### Why use Docker and containers instead of a Virtual Machine to run our SOC?
We are going to use Docker to run our ELK enviroment instead of a VM and the reason why is due to resource utilization, scalability and less overhead. Container-based virtiualization meakes it easier to develop, test and deploy updates independently and is it lightweight by sharing a OS/kernel. Here is a quick overview of Docker.

## Setting up EC2 for Elasticsearch on AWS
For this tep you will need an Amazon Web Services AWS account to set up EC2 for Elasticsearch. You can lookup online how to open an account, for the sake of this step I will assume you already have one.  
Set up am EC2 instance and create a key pair to access it. I am using Ubuntu for this step.

## Install Ekasticsearch on EC2
Connect to you instance  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1987c429-e111-4e67-83e6-83a40ae87caf)  
Now make sure your machine is up to date by running sudo apt update.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95eb8b7e-82eb-46a2-8f44-cd128e7249aa)  
now we must install docker using this commands:  
sudo apt install docker-compose  
sudo apt install docker.io  

now we have to create a folder called elasticsearch inside use the command:  
mkdir elasticsearch  
ls  
travel to the folder using the command:  
cd elasticsearch/  
and we must create a file called docker-compose.yml using vi. now , go to [ELK-docker-compose.yml.yml](/ELK-docker-compose.yml.yml) and copy and paste the contents to the file.  
vi docker-compose.yml  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccd81920-d735-4479-9653-68f954e62b59)  
 now save with :wq!  
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56eaba6a-0ad5-4bb8-a67f-1a6c882f523b)

now we must activate it by using the command:  
sudo docker-compose up -d  

This will create containers for Elasticsearch, entreprisesearchand kibana.  
we can use the command sudo docker ps to see the iterms created.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-20-167:~/elasticsearch$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                              NAMES  
7e56841c30a4   docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.15.0                         "/bin/tini -- /usr/l…"   49 seconds ago   Up 48 seconds   0.0.0.0:5601->5601/tcp             elasticsearch_kibana_1  
91da32d252b2   docker.elastic.co/enterprise-search/enterprise-search:7.15.0   "/bin/tini -- /usr/l…"   50 seconds ago   Up 49 seconds   0.0.0.0:3002->3002/tcp             elasticsearch_ent-search_1  
d625a855bfc3   docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.15.0           "/bin/tini -- /usr/l…"   51 seconds ago   Up 50 seconds   0.0.0.0:9200->9200/tcp, 9300/tcp   elasticsearch_elasticsearch_1  

now go to your instance in AWS and make sure to edit inbound rules to allow those ports in.

## How to access elasticsearch and Kibana
go your elasticsearcbsiem instance and find your oublic IP adress, then from [ELK-docker-compose.yml.yml](/ELK-docker-compose.yml.yml) copy the ports and username and passwords listed. go to http://elasticsearch:9200 except take out the elsaticsearch and put in your ip address instead:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce21d724-6305-4de6-9d68-b83d27e72e73)  
you will get something like this:   
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e229f2aa-0306-4fd8-9823-f38baaaa00f7)  
just change the port to kibana which is 5601. It will take you to elastic again and log in using the credentials again.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffb45eb6-419e-4ac4-9c69-c68504cb47f9)  
Now you should be able to get into Elastic.
